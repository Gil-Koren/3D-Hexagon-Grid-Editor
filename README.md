# 3D-Hexagon-Grid-Editor

## What is this?
This repository holds code that can be used to create a hexagon grid with index for each tile, be saved as a resource and loaded later, and can easily add new tiles to create with!

## NOTES
This is still in the very first steps to become a fully functional game tool.
If you have any question feel free to ask me @AniGilKoren on twitter!
Make sure to star the repository to be kept to date with improvments :)
