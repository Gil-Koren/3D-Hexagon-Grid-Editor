# 3D-Hexagon-Grid-Editor

## What is this?
This repository holds code that can be used to create a hexagon grid with index for each tile, be saved as a resource and loaded later, and can easily add new tiles to create with!

## How do I use this?
The To use this tool, you'll need the HexGridTool folder that can be found in the Scenes folder, and the GridPreset.gd and SaveGame.gd from the Scrtips folder.
Then, you can add the HexGridTool scene to your game and it should work!


## NOTES
This is still in the very first steps to become a fully functional game tool.
If you have any question feel free to ask me @AniGilKoren on twitter!
Make sure to star the repository to be kept to date with improvments :)
